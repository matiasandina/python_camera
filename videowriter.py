# video writer
# * writes frames at a fixed rate even if camera's rate varies or is imprecise,
#  possibly dropping or repeating frames in the process
#  (note: for LifeCam, the frame rate depends on the exposure)
# * also writes trajectories (which need to be in sync with frames written)
# * stop() needs to be called at the end of video, unless VideoWriter is
#  instantiated with "with"
# code comes from
